PuréeData is a browser-based PureData interface for a remote, central server that allows live, collaborative patching for anyone, anywhere.

Using Pd's internal messaging system and an accompanying python script, PureéData allows anyone with a browser to modify a public, shared patch running on a server and listen to the results over an OGG audio stream.

The project is freely available for forking on GitHub.  PureéData is in part adapted from code by Jeraman.

PuréeData is a 2011 commission of New Radio and Performing Arts, Inc. (a.k.a Ether-Ore) for its Turbulence web site (http://www.turbulence.org).  It was made possible with funding from the Jerome Foundation.
