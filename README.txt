PureéData is a browser-based PureData interface for a remote, central server that allows live, collaborative patching for anyone, anywhere.

Using Pd's internal messaging system and an accompanying python script, PureéData allows anyone with a browser to modify a public, shared patch running on a server and listen to the results over an OGG audio stream.

The project is freely available for forking on GitHub.  PureéData is in part adapted from code by Jeraman.
